# Seriouser

A Tumblr theme.

## Installation

Until I submit Seriouser to the Tumblr theme directory you'll need to:

1. Login to Tumblr
2. Click the _Customize_ link in your admin area sidebar
3. Select _Edit HTML_
4. Delete all your existing HTML
5. Copy the HTML from the `tumblr.html` file
6. Preview and save your changes

You'll see a few coluring and text options in your Tumblr's _Customize_ options.
